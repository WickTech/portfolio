							<h2>Building a DAO on the ETH-Testnet</h2>
							<h1 class="major"></h1>
							<p>Deployed my own custom <b>ERC-20</b> token, <b>ERC-1155</b> NFT people can mint to join your DAO, <b>governance contract + treasury</b>.Built a <b>DAPP</b> that lets people connect their wallet, get an <b>NFT</b>, see a <b>DAO</b> Dashboard where they can see other members + actually vote on proposals that are executed directly by your <b>governance contract</b>.</p>

							<h2>DAO</h2>
							<blockquote>DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization is an entity with no central leadership. Decisions get made from the bottom-up, governed by a community organized around a specific set of rules enforced on a blockchain. DAO is a community of people with a shared bank account. Decisions around how that bank account is used are made by voting on different proposals that members create. When a proposal gets enough votes, it is executed on-chain.</blockquote>

							<h2>Building a NFT minting app on the ETH-Testnet</h2>
							<h1 class="major"></h1>
							<p>This project will let users connect their <b>Ethereum wallet</b>, and mint an <b>NFTs</b> to their wallet so they actually own it. They'll even be able to re-sell the <b>NFT</b> on <b>OpenSea</b>. The <b>NFT</b> itself can be customized to whatever you want.You'll be able to customize the <b>NFT</b> itself as much as you want at the end and do whatever you want.

								But, the <b>NFTs</b> I'll be going over in these guides are <b>NFTs</b> that are basically a square box with a randomly generated three-word combination at the center. Why? Because I think it's funny lol. Some of these three-word combos are really fkin funny.
								
								Coolest part? Everything will be happening on-chain. This means all the <b>NFT</b> data will live on the <b>blockchain</b> itself.

							<blockquote>An NFT is a digital asset that can come in the form of art, music, in-game items, videos, and more. They are bought and sold online, frequently with cryptocurrency, and they are generally encoded with the same underlying software as many cryptos.</blockquote>
